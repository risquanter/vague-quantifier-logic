# ADR-00X: Architecture Decision Records - Meta Template

**Status:** Active  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Tags:** meta, process, documentation

---

## Purpose

This meta-ADR defines the structure, style, and content depth for all ADRs. 
---

## ADR Template Structure

### Header (Required)
```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Concise Decision Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Accepted (awaiting implementation)| Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Tags:** [3-5 relevant tags]
```

### Context (3-6 bullet points)
**Purpose:** Establish the problem space and constraints.  
**Style:** Bullet points, not paragraphs. Each point states a core principle or constraint.

**Phrasing:** Describe the inherent trade-offs and constraints that make the problem exist — not the state of any prior or existing implementation. Context must remain valid regardless of what code came before or after.

- ❌ `Current DTOs mix client and server concerns` — describes an implementation snapshot
- ❌ `The existing approach requires full resubmission` — describes prior code
- ✅ `A single DTO shape that serves both create and update creates nullable-field ambiguity` — states the principle
- ✅ `Transmitting full structures on every write is bandwidth-intensive and error-prone` — states the trade-off

Avoid: *current*, *existing*, *previously*, *old approach*, *the old X*. Express the underlying quality attribute or constraint instead.

**Example (from ADR-001):**
```markdown
## Context

- External input (HTTP, JSON) is **untrusted**
- Domain objects must be **correct by construction**
- Validation happens at **domain boundaries**, not scattered throughout
- Internal code trusts validated types
```

### Decision (3-5 numbered patterns)
**Purpose:** State the chosen approach with concrete code examples.  
**Style:** Each pattern has a heading, brief explanation (1-2 sentences), and minimal code example showing the pattern.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep code examples short (10-20 lines max)
- Use actual types/classes from codebase
- Show pattern, not full implementation
- Avoid prose—let code speak

**Example (from ADR-001):**
```markdown
## Decision

### 1. Smart Constructor Pattern

Domain objects expose `create()` returning `Validation[ValidationError, DomainObject]`:

```scala
object RiskLeaf {
  def create(id: String, name: String, ...): Validation[ValidationError, RiskLeaf] = {
    // Layer 1: Iron refinement (per-field)
    val idV = toValidation(ValidationUtil.refineId(id, "id"))
    
    // Layer 2: Business rules (cross-field)
    // e.g., minLoss < maxLoss
    
    Validation.validateWith(idV, ...) { ... => RiskLeaf(...) }
  }
}
```
```

### Code Smells (3-5 anti-patterns)
**Purpose:** Show what NOT to do—violations of the decision.  
**Style:** Each smell has BAD/GOOD code comparison. No explanation beyond the code.

**Guidelines:**
- Start with `### ❌ [Anti-Pattern Name]`
- Show BAD code first, then GOOD code
- Keep examples short (5-10 lines each)
- Comments should be in code, not prose

**Example (from ADR-001):**
```markdown
## Code Smells

### ❌ Validation in Service Layer

```scala
// BAD: Service validates raw types
def computeLEC(nTrials: Int, depth: Int) = {
  val validated = for {
    validTrials <- ValidationUtil.refinePositiveInt(nTrials, "nTrials")
    validDepth <- ValidationUtil.refineNonNegativeInt(depth, "depth")
  } yield (validTrials, validDepth)
  // ...
}

// GOOD: Service trusts Iron types
def computeLEC(nTrials: PositiveInt, depth: NonNegativeInt) = {
  // No validation - types guarantee correctness
}
```
```

### Implementation (Optional table)
**Purpose:** Quick reference to where patterns are implemented.  
**Style:** Table mapping location to pattern. 3-12 rows typical. Group related items when the list exceeds 6.

**Example (from ADR-001):**
```markdown
## Implementation

| Location | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| `RiskLeaf.create()` | Smart constructor with Validation |
| `JsonDecoder[RiskLeaf]` | Calls `create()` during parsing |
| `RiskTreeService` | Iron types in signatures, no validation |
```

### Alternatives Rejected (Optional — Approved Extension)
**Purpose:** Record options that were explicitly considered and ruled out, so future readers do not re-litigate closed decisions.  
**Style:** One sub-heading per rejected alternative. Each entry states what the option is, and exactly why it was rejected. Prose is acceptable here (unlike Decision/Code Smells) because trade-off reasoning cannot always be expressed in code.

**Guidelines:**
- Use `### [Alternative Name]` (not ❌/✅ — those belong in Code Smells)
- Lead with a one-line **What** description, then a **Why rejected** block
- Keep each entry to 3-6 lines. Cross-reference the ADR whose principle it violates if applicable
- Omit if only one option was viable — this section exists only when real alternatives were evaluated

**Example:**
```markdown
## Alternatives Rejected

### Reflector operator (emberstack/kubernetes-reflector)
- **What**: annotate source Secret; operator copies to target namespaces automatically
- **Why rejected**: requires cluster-wide Secret R/W RBAC — compromised reflector exposes all namespaces. Mirrors the admin credential rather than provisioning a dedicated role, violating least-privilege (ADR-INFRA-004).
```

> **Schema note:** This section is a deliberate, documented extension to the base ADR schema. It is optional and appears after Implementation, before References. ADRs that capture multi-option decisions (technology choices, operator selection, secret delivery strategies) should include it. ADRs that record a single obvious pattern (e.g., a coding convention) should omit it.

### Cross-ADR Relationship (Optional — Approved Extension)
**Purpose:** Clarify scope boundaries or potential conflicts with other accepted ADRs.  
**Style:** Brief section explaining how this ADR coexists with related ADRs. States which files/packages each governs and where the boundary lies.

**Guidelines:**
- Include only when two ADRs could appear to contradict each other
- Name the related ADR explicitly and state why there is no conflict
- Keep to one short section (5-10 lines), not a per-ADR enumeration
- Omit when the ADR is self-contained with no overlap risk

> **Schema note:** This section is optional and appears after Code Smells, before Implementation. It exists for ADRs that govern overlapping concerns (e.g., error handling policy vs. OCaml preservation policy) where readers might reasonably ask "doesn't ADR-X contradict this?".

### References (Optional)
**Purpose:** External documentation links.  
**Style:** Bulleted list, 2-4 links maximum.

## Sizing Guidelines

**Target:** 100-200 lines total (including code examples)  
**Read time:** Under 10 minutes for humans  
**Context window:** Minimal for AI agents

**Section sizing:**
- Context: 3-6 bullet points
- Decision: 3-5 patterns with code
- Code Smells: 3-5 anti-patterns with examples
- Implementation: 3-12 row table (optional; group related items when exceeding 6)
- Cross-ADR Relationship: 5-10 lines (optional extension — include when overlap risk exists)
- Alternatives Rejected: per-option sub-headings (optional extension — include when ≥2 real options were evaluated)

---

## Writing Style

- **Concise over verbose** - Remove filler words
- **Code over prose** - Show, don't tell
- **Bullets over paragraphs** - Easy scanning
- **Concrete over abstract** - Use actual types from codebase
- **Prescriptive over descriptive** - State what to do, not why it's better
- **Timeless over historical** - Context states enduring constraints, not implementation snapshots; never reference "current", "existing", or "old" code states

---

## Naming Convention

- `ADR-00X` - This meta template
- `ADR-001` to `ADR-999` - Sequential, zero-padded
- Use verb phrases: "Validation Strategy", "Error Handling Pattern", "Dependency Injection Approach"

---

## When to Create

**Do create ADR for:**
- Cross-cutting patterns (validation, error handling)
- Technology choices (libraries, frameworks)
- Architectural constraints (type safety, boundaries)

**Don't create ADR for:**
- Single-feature implementation details
- Temporary workarounds
- Routine refactorings

---

## Reference Implementation

**ADR-001** is the canonical example. When in doubt, match its:
- Structure (Context → Decision → Code Smells → Implementation)
- Depth (concise code examples, minimal prose)
- Style (bullets, code-first, prescriptive)
- Length (~160 lines)

---

## For AI Agents

When creating a new ADR:
1. Copy structure from ADR-001
2. Keep Context to 3-6 bullets stating principles
3. Show 3-5 Decision patterns with minimal code
4. Provide 3-5 Code Smells with BAD/GOOD examples
5. Add Implementation table if helpful (up to 12 rows; group when >6)
6. Add Cross-ADR Relationship section if overlap with another ADR could confuse readers
7. Add Alternatives Rejected if ≥2 real options were evaluated (approved optional extension)
8. Target 100-200 lines total
