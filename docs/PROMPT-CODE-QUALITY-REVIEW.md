## Prompt

You are performing a critical quality review of a Scala 3 codebase (potentially using ZIO / ZIO Prelude).  Review the provided diff or changed files against **both** the general principles and the specific criteria below.  For each criterion, report one of:

- **PASS** — no issues found
- **FINDING (severity)** — describe the issue, its location, and a concrete fix

Severities: **MUST-FIX** (blocks commit), **SHOULD-FIX** (quality debt), **NOTE** (informational).

Do not rubber-stamp.  If something looks fine, say PASS and move on.  If something is wrong, say so plainly.  Do not propose options without flagging which decision you need from me — **all decisions and ambiguities are mine to resolve**.

The specific criteria below are **not exhaustive**.  They encode lessons learned so far, but the reviewer must think beyond the checklist.  Use the general principles to catch issues the specific rules have not yet anticipated.

## General Principles

Apply these throughout the review.  Any violation of a general principle is a valid finding even if no specific criterion below covers it.

### Functional Design Practices

- Favour **immutability, referential transparency, and composition** over mutable state and imperative control flow.
- Prefer **total functions** (returning `Option`, `Either`, sealed error types) over partial functions and exceptions.
- Push side effects to the edges; keep the core pure.
- Use **higher-order functions, combinators, and type classes** to reduce boilerplate and increase composability.
- Avoid premature abstraction — but recognise when duplication signals a missing abstraction.

### Clean Code Practices

- Names should reveal intent.  Avoid abbreviations that require mental decoding.
- Keep functions short, single-purpose, and at a consistent level of abstraction.
- Eliminate dead code, dead imports, dead parameters.  Code that is not exercised is a liability.
- Follow the **principle of least surprise**: APIs should behave as their types and names promise.
- Prefer **explicit over implicit** when implicit behaviour could mislead a reader.

### Category-Theoretic & Algebraic Soundness

- When a type class instance is provided (Monoid, Functor, Monad, Applicative, etc.), ensure it **satisfies the laws** of that abstraction — identity, associativity, naturality, etc.
- Consider whether an algebraic abstraction (Semigroup, Monoid, Functor, foldMap, traverse, etc.) would simplify or unify the code before writing ad-hoc logic.
- Composition of augmenters, transformations, or pipelines should respect **associativity** — `(f andThen g) andThen h ≡ f andThen (g andThen h)`.
- Avoid partial or lawless instances in public scope.  When a partial operation is required, make partiality explicit in the type (`Option`, `Either`) rather than throwing.

### Defensive Design

- **Validate at the boundary, trust within the core.**  Parsed/validated data should carry its proof in the type.
- Avoid `asInstanceOf`, runtime type checks, and stringly-typed APIs unless absolutely necessary.
- Treat warnings as errors in spirit — every warning is a potential bug or maintenance trap.

## Specific Criteria

### 1. ADR Compliance

- Do the changes align with the stated goals and constraints of any applicable Architecture Decision Records?
- Are any ADR constraints violated or silently weakened?
- If the change scope exceeds what an ADR anticipated, is the deviation justified and documented?
- Are ADR references in code comments and scaladoc accurate and up-to-date?

### 2. Type Safety & Sound Theoretical Foundations

- Are type class instances (Monoid, Functor, Ordering, Numeric, etc.) **lawful**?
  - Identity, associativity, commutativity where required.
  - If an instance is partial (throws on some inputs), it must not be globally summoned — scope it to the narrowest possible visibility or eliminate it in favour of explicit domain logic.
- Are type class context bounds (`[D: Ordering]`) used only where the full contract is honoured?
- Is `asInstanceOf` / `isInstanceOf` used?  If so, is it genuinely unavoidable?
- Are variance annotations (`+D`, `-D`, invariant `D`) correct and intentional?
- Does any new generic code introduce unchecked type erasure at runtime?

### 3. Functional Design

- Are functions pure where possible?  Is side-effectful code pushed to the edges?
- Are partial functions avoided in favour of total functions (returning `Option`, `Either`, or a sealed error type)?
- Is pattern matching exhaustive?  Are `MatchError` risks eliminated?
- Does composition (`andThen`, `flatMap`, monoid `combine`) behave as callers expect — especially identity and associativity?
- Are new abstractions justified by two or more concrete use sites, or are they speculative?

### 4. API Surface & Design Integrity

- Are any **new public types, methods, or extension methods** introduced that are not required by the task?  Unused API surface is a liability.
- Are any **existing public APIs removed or signature-changed** without corresponding migration of all call sites?
- Do default parameter values remain unchanged unless the task explicitly requires it?
- Does backward compatibility hold for external consumers (library users, downstream modules)?

### 5. Code Duplication & DRY

- Is any logic duplicated across files or within a file?
- Could repeated patterns be extracted into a shared helper, type class, or combinator?
- Are there near-identical code blocks that differ only in a type parameter or constant?

### 6. Secure Design

- Are exceptions used only for truly exceptional / unrecoverable situations?  Prefer typed errors (`Either`, `ZIO` error channel).
- Are error messages free of sensitive data (secrets, PII, internal paths)?
- Is input validation (arity checks, bounds, nullability) performed at the boundary?
- Are there any new `catch` blocks that silently swallow exceptions?

### 7. Compiler Hygiene

- Does the code compile with **zero warnings** under the project's configured scalac options?
- Are all `import` statements used?  No unused or wildcard imports that widen implicit scope unexpectedly?
- Are deprecation warnings addressed or explicitly suppressed with a documented reason?
- For Scala 3: are `infix` annotations present on methods designed for infix use?

### 8. Test Quality

- Do tests cover the new/changed behaviour — happy path, edge cases, error paths?
- Are removed tests justified by removed functionality (not just inconvenient)?
- Is the net test count change explained?
- Do test fixtures use realistic types (not `Any` or `asInstanceOf` casts) matching production code?
- Are there tests for algebraic laws (identity, associativity) where applicable?

### 9. Documentation & Comments

- Are scaladoc `@param`, `@tparam`, `@return`, `@see` tags accurate after the change?
- Are stale comments or TODOs removed or updated?
- Do `@see` links point to correct ADR sections and related types?
